Coin Stats
=========

1. Create a cache folder the web server can write to
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
  - By default it expects the cache folder to be directly under the coinstats directory. You can change that by changing line 13 of fetch.php. At some point, I'll make the configuration better and it will be an option there.

2. Rename config.dist.ini.php to config.ini.php
3. Add your information to config.ini.php

If you want to change the order of things, reorder the sections in config.ini
